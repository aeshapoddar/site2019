            <b><u>Indian Classical Dance- A Complete Art</u></b><br>
            Mr.Ayre mesmerized the audience by performing a graceful bharatanatyam piece.
            He started off by talking about ‘Natyaveda’, which is a beautiful creation by Lord Brahma for the wellbeing of human beings. He shared how he was always inclined towards Indian art forms, it fascinated him. He spoke about how his design study, impacted his dance performances. “Design is like dance on paper and dance is drawing on stage.”
            Talking about the 10 essential qualities to be a good performer, he highligted the importance of music. Dance is music made visible, it is a play of emotions and dance is sculptures coming alive. He stated that no Indian theatre is just an entertainment. It is designed for enlightenment and works best as a personality development source.
            He ended with a performance describing the completeness of Indian classical dances.
